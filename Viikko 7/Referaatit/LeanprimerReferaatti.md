### Summary of "Lean Primer" by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde
Lean Primer introduces the reader into Lean and the Lean Thinking. First the document opens the background to lean by discussing about Lean Thinking. This refers to the Toyota Way, which means that it is "strong, resilient, and improves over time".
Lean is summarised as "The Lean Thinking House", where the foundation of the house contains the mentors of lean (also known as leaders). These leaders then pass the lean thinking to their underlings as teachers.
The pillars include "Respect for People" and "Continuous Improvement". These pillars describe the culture of Lean and this is reflected towards the workers by not making people do wasteful work and reinforcing teamwork within the company.
The second pillar is based on several ideas where it tells the workers to always aim to make himself better.
The goal of the lean thinking way is to deliver value for the customer as quickly as possible.
Finally the document tells about the principles of lean which are handy for people who want to integrate Lean to their work environment.
